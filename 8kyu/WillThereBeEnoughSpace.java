// You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

//     cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
//     on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
//     wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.

// If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.
